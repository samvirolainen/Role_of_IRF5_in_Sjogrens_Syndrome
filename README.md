# Colocalization of Autoimmune Risk Loci with Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) -

## Project Goals 
- Curate Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) data for autoimmune diseases and fine map risk loci to identify causal variants 
- Identify and fine map QTL data 
- Perform colocalization analysis to identify the impact of genetic variation on mRNA (eQTL) and protein abundance (pQTL)
